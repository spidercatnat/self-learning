# self-learning
A monorepo of things I have partially or completely dived into in my spare time.



## Blockchain
### eth-movie-ratings

Yeah, a crypto project. I'm laughing too. To be quite frank, I'm more interested in the theory behind Blockchain than making apps. Regardless, this little exercise exists.


## FaunaDB
### faunadb-nodejs-examples
There was a period of time where I practically lived on the FaunaDB Slack channel. This repo is likely out of date and no longer maintained, but I still love FaunaDB and would probably use it as a database in my next full-stack project.

## Rust
### get-rusty
Rust is so beautiful and esoteric. I particularly like how the Rust ecosystem treats WASM as a first-class citizen.

## Go
### go-grpc-learning
gRPC and protobufs are neat. I wanted to learn how it works. So I did.

### go-ml
I see a lot of potential in Go as a tool for data science and machine learning. It is still not mature in this area, but shows promise regardless.

## Python
### kivy-pong
A pong game created using the Kivy framework.

### python-ml
Ok, this repo doesn't exist yet. I still need to gather my Python projects in one place.
